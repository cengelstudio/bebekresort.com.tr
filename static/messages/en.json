    "description": "Located in the center of Kozlu village, at the foothills of Kaz Mountains, with its high location and sea view of Lesbos Island, the upcycling-themed Bebek Resort is as small as a baby. Only 97.5 square meters! This small area is worth visiting because it will make you wonder whether you are in a neighborhood, hotel, cafe or bistro, museum or parking lot, cruise ship or caravan, or in the past or present!",
